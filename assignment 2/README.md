I learned a ton about coding, atom, and github this week. I am a beginner at all of this. I followed through one of the side projects in the homework and created a website using atom. I couldnt believe I did it! It brought me to a whole new understanding on how some of this stuff works. It is taking me a lot of time to get through the work. I am also having a hard time understanding some things. One example would be why my hyperlink didnt turn blue. I redid it a dozen times with the same results. Also, Im not sure if I linked the responses.txt correctly.
