#README.md
HTML can have one one head element and one body element. These are seperated so they can be set up.
Structural is the fuction and semantic is the text and what it looks like.

I made another website. This time I used a recipe from Betty Crocker and set up a link to go with it. I had a hard time getting the link from the INDEX page to the CONTACT page and am still unsure if I did it right. I would like to see what I might have done wrong if I did do something wrong, or a better explanation.
